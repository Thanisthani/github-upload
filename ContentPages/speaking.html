        <h4 class="topic">How Is Your Day?</h4>
           <p>When compared to speaking in the future and past, speaking in the present is not a common thing.  But there are instances that you have to speak the in the present tense. It is common to have a conversation using present tense when you run into somebody or when you make or receive a phone call. So it is important to know how to communicate in present tense.<br>
            the most common questions you will run into are 
           </p>
               <p class="p1">
               “How are you doing?” <br>
               “How is your day going?” <br>
               “What are you doing now?”
               </p>
            <p> When it comes to these types of questions you have to remember that you are talking about what is currently going on. So, you have to use the present tense.</p>
               <p class="p1">
                I’m watching a movie on my computer because I have nothing to do.” <br>
                “I’m at the gym working out.” <br>
                “I’m pretty busy right now. I’m doing my homework.” <br>
                “My project deadline is around the corner. So, I’m currently in the process of finishing my task.”
                </p>
           <p> Some example conversations to practice.</p>
               <p class="p1">
                  A: “What are you doing now?” <br>
                  B: “I’m playing tennis with my friends at the gymnasium.” <br>
                  A: “I didn’t know you play tennis. Are you having fun?” <br>
                  B: “I’m having a great time. How about you?  What are you doing?” <br>
                  A: “I’m taking a break from my homework. There seems to be no end to the amount of work I have to do.”<br>
                  B: “I’m glad I’m not in your shoes.” <br> <br>

                  A: “Hello Mike! What are you doing here?” <br>
                  B: “I’m meeting  a friend here for dinner. How about you?” <br>
                  A: “I’m on my way home but I needed to stop by the bookshop to buy a book.” <br>
                  B:  “Didn’t you finish  school yet?” <br>
                  A: “I have one more year, and then I’m done.” <br>
                  B: “What are you majoring in?” <br>
                  A: “ I’m  majoring in physiology.” <br>
                  B:  “ Do you like your major?” <br>
                  A:  “Yeah ,I really find the subjects very interesting. I’m enjoying  all my classes.” <br>
                  B: “That’s great.” <br>
                  A: “I’d better go now. I don’t want to miss the bus.” <br>
                  B: “Alright, I’ll talk to you later then.” <br>
                  A: “Okay, see you later.”
                 </p> <br>
         <h4 class="topic">Tomorrow's Plan</h4>
           <p>Talking about the future is something that is done very frequently. Whenever we are talking about our dreams or simply telling someone what we will do  is spoken in the future tense.</p>
            <h5>Examples:</h5>
                <p class="p1">
                  “I’m going to see John tomorrow.” <br>
                  “I’m going to go home next week.” <br>
                  “I will meet you there at five.”
                </p>
            <p>When we are using going to it is better to indicate a future indicator like tomorrow, next week, tonight etc. Otherwise, this can come under the present tense.</p>
                <p class="p1">
                   “What are you going to do tonight?” <br>
                   “I plan on meeting  Mike after dinner. We’re going to watch a  movie.” <br> <br>
       
                    “What are you doing next week?” <br>
