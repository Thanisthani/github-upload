        <p>
On the 24th of January 2020 following a devastating bushfire season Australia reported the first four confirmed cases of covert 19 domestic way.Today Australia is at a standstill normally Sydney is bustling with workers
families and tourists now there are public health orders in place which restrict people from leaving their homes unless for essential purposes most workplaces have reduced staffing levels restaurants are bare iconic
attractions are eerily quiet there is a strain on national supply chains particularly impacting products such as face masks and hand sanitizers supermarkets have introduced purchasing
limits to alleviate some of this pressure.This virus has fueled a significant global economic downturn and fundamentally changed the way we live two-thirds of businesses across all
sectors reported taking a hit to revenue or cash flow due to covert 19 as well as decreased demand as of the 30th of March the federal government has committed to 320 billion
dollars of economic support packages this equates to sixteen point four percent of Australia's GDP tourists would normally flock to the iconic Sydney Harbor tourism in 2018-2019 generated 3.1 percent of
Australia's GDP or a sum of sixty point eight billion dollars with bans on international arrivals in Australia the industry has taken a significant hit many hospitality and retail workers have lost their jobs or had a drastic
reduction in hours the hospitality sector accounts for 8%
of the Australian workforce and as it stands 43% of businesses in hospitality have stood down staff on unpaid leave on average fifty thousand people visit Bondi Beach per day this number Peaks to
100,000 in the warmer months at the time of recording these images the beach was empty and the surrounding area unusually peaceful businesses and educational institutions
have shifted to online meetings and lesson delivery 40% of businesses have changed the way they deliver goods and services for example many retail stores are offering online ordering only
with more time to themselves individuals have a chance to get outside and be active focusing on their physical and mental health families and friends are spending more time with one another
spending time outdoors together reconnecting via online video chat learning new skills together this is a challenging time if you need help reach out we can help one another even though we are a part we are all in
this together</p>

What is Happiness? Can we find it in a new pair of shoes a
fast car or a bigger house or does real happiness lie somewhere else.Hundreds of studies have proved that
spending time in nature can make us feel better both in mind and body in a way that nothing else can
we wanted to find out whether simply watching footage of the natural world
could have the same effect.Last year we partnered with Professor Dhaka Keltner an expert in human psychology and emotion at the University
of California Berkeley for this project.<br>
He has reviewed over 150 scientific studies that explore the positive effect of nature on humans we also asked over
7500 people in six countries to tell us how they were feeling before and after watching planet Earth two clips
this data showed significant increases in joy contentment curiosity or
amazement and wonder and clear reductions in tiredness and low energy it even reduced stress especially among
younger viewers these findings revealed that wildlife programs can cause viewers to experience positive emotions my study
of human happiness has revealed that these emotions amazement Wonder and awe
are the foundations of a powerful form of real human happiness <br>
Real happiness is a deeper less transient form of happiness that can positively affect our
health so by simply watching incredible footage of our natural world you too can
experience these uplifting emotions helping you to be more connected with this amazing place we call home.
